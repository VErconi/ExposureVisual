Description: Uses decomposeTumorGenomes() function of decompTumor2Sig to 
    determine the contributions of mutation frequencies obtained with 
    readGenomesFromMPF() decompTumor2Sig function according to a specific 
    model of mutational signatures (Alexandrov or Shiraishi) in a set of tumor 
    genomes from a MPF (mutation position format) file. The resulting 
    contributions are then hierarchically clustered and visualized as a heatmap.
